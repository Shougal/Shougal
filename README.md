## Hi there 👋 I'm Shoug

🎓 CS @ University of Virginia | 💻 Software Engineer | 🧠 Architecture & Systems Enthusiast

I'm passionate about building **real products** with **clean architecture**, solving engineering challenges, and writing code that scales. Whether it's mobile, backend, or full-stack—I love crafting software that *just works*.
